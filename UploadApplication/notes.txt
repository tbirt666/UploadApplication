details of work and repo https://github.com/tbirt666/UploadApplication (some notes in commits)


Initial Thoughts / Plan

- Setup WebAPI Solution with Test project and .gitignore

- create git repository

- create models (ContactUpload, Contact, Address?)

- ContactUpload fields all set as text for inport before validation/sanitisation/mapping

- create Upload controller (POST) for file upload
- create services, repository (Contact, Upload)

- create frontend react app
- create react contact component for file upload form

config settings
Upload directory currently: E:\Dev\UploadApplication\UploadApplication\App_Data\Uploads in web.config 


Still to do
- Need to add IoC Dependancy injection
- Need to add react.js app to hit file upload controller, and deal with Contact CRUD
- REact File upload component/form, 
- Need to complete the Contact Service and get Mocked unit tests and intergration tests round it


Possible Further Work

API Security, File upload limits/anti virus 
react drag and dropfile upload, upload status
